The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is firmly committed to fulfilling its statutory mandate from the Congress of promoting maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The Committee seeks to explain its monetary policy decisions to the public as clearly as possible. Such clarity facilitates well-informed decisionmaking by households and businesses, reduces economic and financial uncertainty, increases the effectiveness of monetary policy, and enhances transparency and accountability, which are essential in a democratic society.

Inflation at the rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve's statutory mandate. The Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below this objective. Communicating this symmetric inflation goal clearly helps anchor longer-term inflation expectations, which, in turn, helps the Committee achieve maximum employment and price stability.

The maximum level of employment is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market. These factors may change over time and may not be directly measurable. Consequently, it would not be appropriate to specify a fixed goal for employment; rather, the Committee's policy decisions must be informed by assessments of the maximum level of employment, recognizing that such assessments are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision. The Committee considers a wide range of indicators in making these assessments. Information about Committee participants' estimates of the longer-run normal rates of output growth and unemployment is published four times per year in the Summary of Economic Projections.

The Committee expects that, in most circumstances, employment and inflation will be more stable if interest rates are in a range that, over time, is neither too low nor too high. Achieving these symmetric dual mandate goals is expected to sustain a federal funds rate that, in the longer run, is consistent with an inflation rate of 2 percent and an unemployment rate that does not exceed longer-run estimates.

The Committee recognizes that decisions about the target range for the federal funds rate involve substantial uncertainty and depend on assessments of many factors, including current conditions, the medium-term outlook, and the balance of risks, along with the likelihood and potential costs of employment or inflation deviating from levels the Committee judges to be consistent with its mandate.
